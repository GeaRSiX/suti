I collected all the log transcripts from Star Trek TOS :)

To run this example you'll need to explicity set the root template to use (see
templates/ files). The root templates produce their different file formats
denoted by the filename (e.g. html.tmpl produces a html file).

An example of how you can run one of these examples:

	dati -cfg dati.cfg -r templates/html.tmpl > out.html

Then open out.html to see the results.

See the resulting html file hosted here: gearsix.net/star-trek-logs/tos.html
