# CHANGELOG

## v0.2.0

- massive refactored to data API:
  - removed type Data, user will want to use their own data types
  - LoadData() and LoadDataFile() now takes an interface{} (pointer) to write the result to
  - removed LoadDataFiles(), bulk loading is now user responsibility
  - removed GenerateSuperData() & MergeData(), these were superfluous fucntions
- added file.go, which currently only has SortFileList() to stand-in for the missing data sort
functionality found in LoadDataFiles()
- refactored cmd/suti.go to work with the new API, no functional changes
- ".mustache" is now accepted as a mustache file extension (as intended)
- bugfixes
